# COVID-Android-App
The app tracks the NYC COVID data and notifies the user once it's updated. 

I started this project to learn about android app development and web-scrapping in java. 

- Using the Jsoup library, I web-scrapped the daily COVID data in NYC. I also displayed a graph representation of the data using a Webview. 
- I also created a background service. This service checks the NYC website that has the data every 5 seconds to see if the data has been updated. If the data is updated, the app sends a notification to the user indicating that the data was updated.
